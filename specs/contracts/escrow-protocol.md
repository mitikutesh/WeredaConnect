# Escrow Protocol Contract (Telebirr Integration)

## Version
1.2.0

## Parties
- **Mobile** (client) -- initiates payment intents, displays escrow status, submits disputes
- **Backend** (server) -- manages escrow state machine, integrates with Telebirr, enforces idempotency and audit trail
- **Telebirr Gateway** (external) -- holds/releases/refunds funds via Ethio Telecom's mobile money API

---

## Overview

The Escrow Protocol enables secure payment between buyers and farmers on WeredaConnect using Telebirr, Ethiopia's dominant mobile money platform. Funds are held in a platform-managed Telebirr escrow account until delivery is verified (F-12), at which point the platform releases payment to the farmer minus a configurable commission.

**This is the highest-priority feature in the backlog (F-13, score 19)** because it directly enables revenue, prevents payment fraud, and satisfies Ethiopian Fayda ID compliance requirements.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Server-authoritative**: Escrow operations are NOT synced via POST /sync. All payment mutations go through dedicated `/escrow/*` endpoints because money movement requires server coordination.
- **Idempotent operations**: Every escrow action uses an idempotency key to prevent double-charges on flaky 3G networks.
- **Platform-held escrow**: Funds are held in WeredaConnect's Telebirr business account (simplest model for MVP).
- **Offline intent, online execution**: Payment intent can be queued offline; actual fund movement requires connectivity.
- **Telebirr abstraction**: Integration is behind an `ITelebirrGateway` interface to allow mock implementations during development.

## Order-Funded Escrow (v1.1.0)

The order-payment leg (order `payment_submitted` → `funded`, see
`order-lifecycle.md`) verifies and holds the buyer's money BEFORE any delivery
exists. The server materializes an escrow record at that moment so
`GET /escrow/history`, refunds, and release all flow through this protocol:

- **Creation**: applied by the funding path (`EscrowService.CreateFromFundedOrderAsync`,
  called from the sync Lambda's auto-fund today; the live gateway leg MUST call the
  same method). The record is born `escrowed` — the hold already happened on the
  payment leg, so no Telebirr HoldFunds call is made.
- **Identity & idempotency**: `escrowId = "escrow-order-{orderId}"` and
  `createdAt = order.paymentVerifiedAt` — a deterministic (PK, SK) pair, so retries
  and races collapse onto one conditional put.
- **Fields**: `source: "order"`, `orderId`, NO `deliveryId` (the sparse
  DeliveryIndex gains the record only at linkage), `telebirrRef`/`telebirrHoldRef` =
  the order's payment reference (`cbeTransactionId`, else `ORDER-FUND-{orderId}`),
  `amount = orderTotal`, `farmerPayout = cropCost`, `truckerPayout = transportCost`,
  `commission = amount − farmerPayout − truckerPayout` (exact remainder — the split
  always reconciles), `expiresAt = createdAt + 7 days`.
- **Delivery linkage**: creating a delivery REQUIRES `orderId`
  (see `delivery-verification-api.md`); after the delivery write the server
  backfills `escrow.deliveryId`, which activates every by-delivery mechanism
  (confirmation stamping, auto-release, the self-pickup fail-closed QR gate,
  `GET /escrow/by-delivery`). Linkage re-points only when the previously linked
  delivery is `cancelled`; it refuses terminal orders; and it SELF-HEALS a missing
  record while the order is still `funded`/`accepted`.
- **Refund on reject/cancel**: `funded → rejected|cancelled` stamps the escrow
  `expiresAt = now` (+`refundReason`); the hourly auto-refund cron then pays the
  buyer through the standard gateway path (≤1h latency, mock and live alike).
- **Order-aware auto-refund**: for `source == "order"` escrows the 7-day sweep
  loads the order first. It refunds only a stale-`funded` (farmer never responded)
  or terminal (`rejected`/`cancelled`) order; a progressing order
  (`accepted` … `disbursing`) gets `expiresAt` pushed +48h instead. Fail-safe: if
  the orders table isn't wired, order-sourced escrows are skipped, never refunded
  blind. A stale-funded order is cancelled FIRST via version-CAS
  (`cancelReason: escrow_refunded`) — the CAS fences out a concurrent farmer
  accept (on conflict the refund is skipped and the next sweep re-classifies) —
  and only then is the money refunded, so money and order state agree.
- **Double-charge guard**: `POST /escrow/initiate` returns `409 ESCROW_024`
  ("Funds for this order are already held in escrow") when the delivery's order
  already carries an active escrow.
- **Documented divergences**: order-funded records carry
  `buyerFaydaVerified/farmerFaydaVerified = false` unless a users table is wired
  (KYC enforcement belongs on the order-payment leg — follow-up); amounts outside
  the initiate API's 100–500,000 ETB band are still recorded (they reflect money
  actually held). Listing-stock restore on refund remains a known gap.

## Endpoints

**Base path**: `/escrow`
**Authentication**: All endpoints require Cognito JWT (Bearer token).
**Content-Type**: `application/json`

### 1. POST /escrow/initiate

Buyer initiates escrow payment for a delivery. Queues a Telebirr HoldFunds call.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "deliveryId": "delivery-001",
  "buyerId": "buyer-456",
  "farmerId": "farmer-123",
  "amount": 15000.00,
  "currency": "ETB",
  "idempotencyKey": "buyer-456:delivery-001:initiate:1708084800000"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `deliveryId` | string (UUID) | Yes | Must reference an existing delivery | The delivery this payment covers |
| `buyerId` | string (UUID) | Yes | Must match JWT `sub` claim | Buyer initiating payment |
| `farmerId` | string (UUID) | Yes | Must be a verified user AND the delivery's `farmerId` | Farmer receiving payment |
| `amount` | number | Yes | 100.00 - 500,000.00 ETB; must equal the linked order's `orderTotal` | Total payment amount in ETB |
| `currency` | string | Yes | Fixed: `"ETB"` | Ethiopian Birr |
| `idempotencyKey` | string | Yes | Format: `{buyerId}:{deliveryId}:{action}:{timestamp}` | Prevents duplicate charges |

#### Success Response

**Status**: `201 Created`

```json
{
  "escrowId": "escrow-789",
  "deliveryId": "delivery-001",
  "buyerId": "buyer-456",
  "farmerId": "farmer-123",
  "amount": 15000.00,
  "commission": 375.00,
  "farmerPayout": 14625.00,
  "currency": "ETB",
  "status": "initiated",
  "telebirrRef": null,
  "toPayUrl": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-02-17T10:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-02-24T10:00:00Z",
  "message": "Escrow initiated. Waiting for Telebirr confirmation."
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `toPayUrl` | string \| null | **Async gateways only.** The Telebirr H5 checkout URL the buyer opens to complete payment. Present when the real gateway is used; `null` for the synchronous mock (which returns `status: "escrowed"` directly). **Transient — never persisted; never returned by `GET /escrow/{id}`.** |

#### Asynchronous Payment (real Telebirr gateway)

With the real Telebirr gateway, fund collection is **asynchronous** (C2B H5 checkout):

1. `POST /escrow/initiate` creates the escrow in `initiated` and returns a
   `toPayUrl` (funds are **not** yet held; `telebirrRef` stays `null`).
2. The client opens `toPayUrl`; the buyer pays in Telebirr.
3. Telebirr calls the server webhook (`POST /webhooks/telebirr`), which — after
   signature + timestamp + replay + amount checks — transitions the escrow
   `initiated → escrowed` and stamps the real `telebirrRef`.
4. The client polls `GET /escrow/{id}` until `status` is `escrowed`.

If the buyer never completes payment, the escrow stays `initiated` and the
reconciliation cron cancels it only **after** the Telebirr payment window
(`timeout_express`, 120m) plus a safety buffer has elapsed — so a slow-but-valid
payment is never stranded in `cancelled`.

With the **mock** gateway (`TELEBIRR_MOCK=true`), `HoldFunds` is synchronous:
`initiate` returns `status: "escrowed"` immediately and no `toPayUrl`.

#### Idempotent Duplicate Response

If the same `idempotencyKey` is received again, return the cached result with `200 OK` (not an error).

```json
{
  "escrowId": "escrow-789",
  "status": "escrowed",
  "telebirrRef": "TBR-2026021710-ABC123",
  "message": "Duplicate request. Returning cached result.",
  "isDuplicate": true

## Telebirr Integration

### ITelebirrGateway Interface

All Telebirr interactions are abstracted behind this interface to enable mock implementations during development.

```
ITelebirrGateway:
  HoldFunds(request: HoldFundsRequest) -> HoldFundsResponse
  ReleaseFunds(request: ReleaseFundsRequest) -> ReleaseFundsResponse
  RefundFunds(request: RefundFundsRequest) -> RefundFundsResponse
  GetTransactionStatus(transactionRef: string) -> TransactionStatus
```

### HoldFundsRequest

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `transactionRef` | string | Idempotency key for Telebirr (maps to escrow idempotencyKey) |
| `buyerPhone` | string | Buyer's Telebirr-registered phone (+251...) |
| `amount` | number | Amount to hold (ETB) |
| `description` | string | "WeredaConnect escrow for delivery {deliveryId}" |

### HoldFundsResponse

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Whether the hold succeeded |
| `telebirrRef` | string | Telebirr's reference ID for this hold |
| `errorCode` | string | Telebirr error code (if failed) |
| `errorMessage` | string | Human-readable error (if failed) |

### ReleaseFundsRequest

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `transactionRef` | string | Idempotency key |
| `holdRef` | string | Original hold reference (from HoldFundsResponse) |
| `farmerPhone` | string | Farmer's Telebirr-registered phone |
| `amount` | number | Amount to release (after commission deduction) |
| `platformCommission` | number | Commission amount retained by platform |

### RefundFundsRequest

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `transactionRef` | string | Idempotency key |
| `holdRef` | string | Original hold reference |
| `buyerPhone` | string | Buyer's Telebirr phone for refund |
| `amount` | number | Full amount to refund (no commission deducted) |

### Mock Implementation (Development)

For development and testing, `MockTelebirrGateway` returns success responses with deterministic reference IDs:
- Hold: `MOCK-HOLD-{escrowId}-{timestamp}`
- Release: `MOCK-RELEASE-{escrowId}-{timestamp}`
- Refund: `MOCK-REFUND-{escrowId}-{timestamp}`

The mock simulates a 500ms delay to mimic real API latency. It also supports a `SIMULATE_FAILURE` flag in metadata to test error handling paths.

### Real Implementation Pattern

The real `TelebirrGateway` wraps Ethio Telecom's B2B API:
1. Authenticate with Telebirr merchant credentials (stored in AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Submit transaction with `transactionRef` as the idempotency key
3. Poll or receive webhook for confirmation
4. Map Telebirr-specific error codes to `ESCROW_*` error codes
5. All calls have a 30-second timeout with 2 retries (exponential backoff: 5s, 15s)
6. Log all requests/responses (with PII redacted) for audit

---

## Idempotency Requirements

Idempotency is **critical** for payment operations. Ethiopian 3G networks frequently drop connections mid-request, so clients will retry.

### Idempotency Key Format

```
{actor}:{entityId}:{action}:{timestamp}
```

Examples:
- Buyer initiates: `buyer-456:delivery-001:initiate:1708084800000`
- System releases: `system:escrow-789:release:1708171200000`
- Buyer disputes: `buyer-456:escrow-789:dispute:1708171200000`
- Admin refunds: `admin:escrow-789:refund:1708257600000`

### Server Processing Flow

```
1. Receive escrow request with idempotencyKey
2. Check EscrowIdempotency table (DynamoDB) for existing key
3. If key exists:
   a. Return cached result (200 OK, isDuplicate: true)
   b. Do NOT re-process
4. If key does not exist:
   a. Begin processing
   b. Write idempotency record BEFORE calling Telebirr
   c. Call Telebirr gateway
   d. Update idempotency record with result
   e. Return result (201 Created or 200 OK)
5. If processing fails midway:
   a. Idempotency record exists with "processing" status
   b. Next retry detects this and checks Telebirr status
   c. Reconcile state based on Telebirr's response
```

### Idempotency Table Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `idempotencyKey` | String (PK) | Composite key |
| `escrowId` | String | Associated escrow |
| `status` | String | `processing`, `completed`, `failed` |
| `result` | String | JSON-encoded response (for cache return) |
| `telebirrRef` | String | Telebirr reference (if applicable) |
| `createdAt` | Number | Unix timestamp (ms) |
| `expiresAt` | Number (TTL) | Auto-delete after 30 days |

---

## DynamoDB Key Design

### EscrowsTable

| Key | Field | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Partition Key** | `escrowId` | Unique escrow identifier |
| **Sort Key** | `createdAt` | ISO 8601 timestamp |

**GSI: DeliveryIndex**:
- Partition key: `deliveryId`
- Sort key: `createdAt`
- Use case: Look up escrow by delivery (1:1 relationship)

**GSI: BuyerStatusIndex**:
- Partition key: `buyerId`
- Sort key: `createdAt`
- Use case: Buyer's payment history, sorted by recency

**GSI: FarmerStatusIndex**:
- Partition key: `farmerId`
- Sort key: `createdAt`
- Use case: Farmer's payment history, sorted by recency

**GSI: StatusExpiresIndex**:
- Partition key: `status`
- Sort key: `expiresAt`
- Use case: Find escrowed items nearing expiry (for auto-refund cron)

### EscrowAuditTable

| Key | Field | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Partition Key** | `escrowId` | Parent escrow |
| **Sort Key** | `timestamp` | When the audit event occurred |

No GSIs needed. Audit entries are always queried by escrowId and sorted by time.

### EscrowIdempotencyTable

| Key | Field | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Partition Key** | `idempotencyKey` | Composite idempotency key |

TTL field: `expiresAt` (30 days). No GSIs needed.

### Query Patterns

| Query | Table/Index | Key Condition | Filter |
|-------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Get escrow by ID | EscrowsTable (PK) | `escrowId = X` | -- |
| Get escrow for delivery | DeliveryIndex | `deliveryId = X` | -- |
| Buyer's history | BuyerStatusIndex | `buyerId = X`, SK between dates | `status = Y` (optional) |
| Farmer's history | FarmerStatusIndex | `farmerId = X`, SK between dates | `status = Y` (optional) |
| Expiring escrows | StatusExpiresIndex | `status = escrowed`, SK < now + 24h | -- |
| Audit trail | EscrowAuditTable | `escrowId = X` | -- |
| Idempotency check | EscrowIdempotencyTable (PK) | `idempotencyKey = X` | -- |

---

## Validation Rules

### Amount Validation

| Rule | Constraint | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Minimum transaction | 100.00 ETB | Below this, Telebirr fees make transactions uneconomical |
| Maximum transaction | 500,000.00 ETB | Regulatory limit; amounts above this require additional KYC |
| Precision | 2 decimal places | ETB sub-unit (santim) is 1/100 |
| Currency | ETB only | Ethiopian Birr is the only supported currency |

### Fayda ID Verification

| Rule | Constraint | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Required for amounts > 10,000 ETB | Both buyer and farmer must have verified Fayda ID | Ethiopian Jan 2026 digital transaction policy |
| Verified during registration (F-03) | Stored as `custom:faydaId` in Cognito | One-time verification, not per-transaction |
| Check at escrow initiation | Server validates Fayda status from user profile | Prevents initiating a transaction that will be rejected |

### Delivery State Validation

Escrow can only be initiated when the associated delivery is in a valid state:
- `pending` -- delivery created, awaiting pickup
- `pickedUp` -- trucker has picked up goods

Escrow CANNOT be initiated when delivery is in:
- `delivered` -- too late; delivery already confirmed without escrow
- `disputed` -- delivery itself is in dispute
- `inTransit` -- allowed only if escrow was initiated before transit

### User Validation

1. `buyerId` must match the JWT `sub` claim (buyers can only pay for their own purchases)
2. `farmerId` must be a registered user with role `farmer`
3. Both users must be phone-verified (`isPhoneVerified: true`)
4. For amounts > 10,000 ETB, both users must have `custom:faydaId` set in Cognito
5. The caller's role claim must be `buyer` (`ESCROW_025`, checked before anything else); the delivery's `buyerId` must be the caller (`ESCROW_026`) and `farmerId` must be the delivery's farmer (`ESCROW_027`). Nothing is written when any of these fail.
6. When the delivery (or, for a delivery without one, the request) names an order, `amount` must equal that order's `orderTotal` (`ESCROW_028`), the order must belong to the caller, and a client `orderId` may only echo the delivery's own. The payout split (farmer / trucker / commission) is then taken from that order, exactly as on the order-funded leg.

### Commission Calculation

```
commission = amount * commissionRate
farmerPayout = amount - commission
```

- `commissionRate` is server-configured (stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store)
- Default: 0.025 (2.5%)
- Minimum commission: 5 ETB (floor)
- Commission is deducted at release time, not at hold time (full amount is escrowed)

---

## Offline Behavior

### What Works Offline

| Action | Offline Behavior | Sync When Online |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| View escrow status | Cached in local Isar (last known state) | Auto-refresh on connectivity |
| Initiate payment | **Payment INTENT** queued locally with `pending_sync` flag | POST /escrow/initiate sent when online |
| Raise dispute | Dispute INTENT queued locally | POST /escrow/dispute sent when online |
| View payment history | Cached list from last sync | Auto-refresh on connectivity |

### What Requires Connectivity

| Action | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Actual fund hold (Telebirr HoldFunds) | Money movement requires Telebirr API |
| Fund release | Server-triggered after delivery confirmation |
| Fund refund | Server-triggered by admin or timeout |

### Offline Payment Intent Flow

```
1. Buyer taps "Pay" on delivery screen
2. Mobile creates local EscrowIntent in Isar:
   - status: "pending_sync"
   - amount, deliveryId, buyerId, farmerId
   - idempotencyKey generated client-side
3. UI shows: "Payment queued. Will process when you have internet."
4. When connectivity detected:
   a. SyncExecutor picks up pending escrow intents
   b. POST /escrow/initiate with queued data
   c. On success: update local Isar with server response
   d. On failure: show notification to buyer
5. Buyer can cancel a pending_sync intent before it syncs
```

### Local Isar Cache (Payment Entity)

The mobile Payment entity (defined in `data-models.md`) caches escrow state locally:
- `paymentId` maps to `escrowId`
- `status` mirrors server state (updated on sync)
- `telebirrRef` populated after server confirms hold
- Stale data detection: if local `updatedAt` is > 1 hour old, show "may be outdated" indicator

---

## Error Handling

### Partial Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|---------|
| **Telebirr hold times out** | Idempotency record set to `processing`. Next retry queries Telebirr for status. If held, mark as `escrowed`. If not, allow re-initiation. |
| **Telebirr hold succeeds but DB write fails** | Idempotency record exists with `processing` status. Retry detects this, queries Telebirr, and reconciles. |
| **Telebirr release fails** | Retry with exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s). After 3 failures, create alert for admin. Funds remain escrowed. |
| **Telebirr refund fails** | Same retry strategy. Admin notified. Buyer sees "refund pending" status. |
| **Double-charge prevention** | Idempotency key checked BEFORE calling Telebirr. Duplicate requests return cached result. |
| **Network drops during initiation** | Client retries with same idempotency key. Server returns cached result if already processed. |

### Reconciliation

A scheduled Lambda (every 6 hours) runs reconciliation:
1. Query all escrows with `status = initiated` older than 30 minutes
2. Check Telebirr for actual hold status
3. Update escrow state if Telebirr confirms hold
4. Cancel escrow if Telebirr has no record of the hold

### Timeout Handling

| Timeout | Duration | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Escrow expiry | 7 days from creation | Auto-refund if delivery not completed |
| Dispute window | 48 hours from delivery confirmation | Auto-release if no dispute raised |
| Telebirr API timeout | 30 seconds per call | Retry with backoff, max 3 attempts |
| Initiated → escrowed timeout | 30 minutes | Reconciliation marks as failed |

---

## Security Considerations

### Payment Data Encryption

- All payment data encrypted at rest in DynamoDB (AWS-managed encryption)
- Telebirr credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager (not environment variables)
- Phone numbers and Fayda IDs encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Audit log entries are immutable (no update/delete operations on EscrowAuditTable)

### Fraud Prevention

| Check | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Velocity check** | Max 5 escrow initiations per buyer per hour |
| **Amount anomaly** | Flag transactions > 3 standard deviations from user's average |
| **Self-trading** | buyerId and farmerId must be different users |
| **Duplicate delivery payment** | One escrow per deliveryId (enforced by DeliveryIndex) |
| **Fayda ID check** | Mandatory for high-value transactions (> 10,000 ETB) |
| **IP geolocation** | Log client IP for forensic analysis (not blocking) |

### Authorization Matrix

| Action | Buyer | Farmer | Admin | System |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Initiate escrow | Yes | No | No | No |
| Cancel (before hold) | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Raise dispute | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Release funds | No | No | Yes | Yes (auto) |
| Refund funds | No | No | Yes | Yes (auto) |
| View own escrow | Yes | Yes | Yes | -- |
| View any escrow | No | No | Yes | -- |
| View audit trail | No | No | Yes | -- |

### Audit Trail

Every escrow state change MUST produce an EscrowAuditEntry. The audit trail is:
- **Append-only**: No updates or deletes
- **Timestamped**: Server-generated UTC timestamps
- **Actor-tracked**: Records who performed the action
- **Telebirr-linked**: Includes Telebirr reference when applicable
- **Retained for 7 years**: Per Ethiopian financial record-keeping practice

---

## Ethiopian Context

### Telebirr

- **Operator**: Ethio Telecom (state-owned, monopoly telecom provider)
- **Users**: 40+ million (as of 2026)
- **Dominance**: Primary mobile money platform in Ethiopia, ahead of M-Pesa and HelloCash
- **USSD access**: Many rural users access Telebirr via USSD (`*127#`) on basic phones
- **B2B API**: Available for merchant integration (used by WeredaConnect)
- **Trust**: Government-backed, higher trust than private payment providers

### Fayda ID (National Digital ID)

- **Mandate**: January 2026 Ethiopian policy requires Fayda ID for digital financial transactions above 10,000 ETB
- **Enrollment**: Growing but not universal; rural adoption still ramping up
- **Integration**: Verified during user registration (F-03), stored in Cognito as `custom:faydaId`
- **Graceful degradation**: Transactions below 10,000 ETB do not require Fayda ID

### Currency: Ethiopian Birr (ETB)

- **Code**: ETB
- **Sub-unit**: Santim (1 ETB = 100 santim)
- **Exchange rate**: Approximately 1 USD = 55 ETB (as of 2026, volatile)
- **Typical transaction sizes on WeredaConnect**:
  - Small: 500-2,000 ETB (single farmer, small load)
  - Medium: 5,000-20,000 ETB (multiple quintals of teff)
  - Large: 50,000-200,000 ETB (bulk wholesale purchase)

### Mobile Money Patterns in Rural Ethiopia

- **Cash-dominant economy**: Mobile money is growing but cash remains king in rural areas
- **Trust barrier**: First-time mobile money users need strong safety signals (escrow status messages, Telebirr confirmation receipts)
- **Shared devices**: Payment screens should show minimal sensitive data; require PIN or biometric confirmation
- **USSD fallback**: Some users may initiate Telebirr payments via USSD rather than in-app; the platform must handle both flows
- **Network interruptions**: Payment confirmations may arrive minutes or hours after initiation; UI must handle async confirmation gracefully

### Low-Literacy Considerations for Payment UI

- Use color-coded status indicators (green = paid, yellow = pending, red = disputed)
- Show amounts prominently with ETB symbol
- Use icons for actions (shield = escrow, checkmark = released, exclamation = disputed)
- Voice confirmation for payment actions ("Are you sure you want to pay 15,000 Birr?")
- Minimise text; maximise visual confirmation flows

---

## Automated Processes

### Auto-Release (Cron)

A scheduled Lambda runs every hour:
1. Query `StatusExpiresIndex` for escrows with `status = escrowed`
2. For each, check if `deliveryConfirmedAt` is set AND `now > disputeWindowEndsAt`
3. If yes, call POST /escrow/release with `trigger = delivery_confirmed`
4. Log audit entry with `actor = system`

### Auto-Refund (Cron)

A scheduled Lambda runs every hour:
1. Query `StatusExpiresIndex` for escrows with `status = escrowed` AND `expiresAt < now`
2. For each expired escrow, call POST /escrow/refund with `trigger = delivery_timeout`
3. Log audit entry with `actor = system`
4. Notify buyer and farmer via push notification

### Reconciliation (Cron)

A scheduled Lambda runs every 6 hours:
1. Query escrows with `status = initiated` AND `createdAt < now - 30 minutes`
2. For each, query Telebirr GetTransactionStatus
3. If Telebirr confirms hold: update to `escrowed`
4. If Telebirr has no record: mark as `cancelled` with reason "hold_failed"
5. Log all reconciliation actions in audit trail

---

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Burst | Per |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----|
| `POST /escrow/initiate` | 10 req/s | 20 | Per user (JWT sub) |
| `POST /escrow/dispute` | 5 req/s | 10 | Per user |
| `POST /escrow/release` | 50 req/s | 100 | Per system (internal) |
| `POST /escrow/refund` | 10 req/s | 20 | Per admin |
| `GET /escrow/{id}` | 50 req/s | 100 | Per user |
| `GET /escrow/history` | 20 req/s | 40 | Per user |

### Pagination

- Default limit: 20 escrows per page
- Maximum limit: 50 escrows per page
- Pagination token: Base64-encoded DynamoDB ExclusiveStartKey
- Token expiration: 24 hours

### Caching

- **Mobile**: Escrow status cached in local Isar database for offline viewing
- **Server**: No CDN caching for escrow endpoints (financial data must be fresh)
- **Idempotency cache**: 30-day TTL in DynamoDB (longer than sync protocol's 7 days because financial records require longer retention)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase R5+
- **Partial refund**: Dispute resolution with partial refund (e.g., 50% refund for partially damaged goods)
- **Multi-party escrow**: Support cooperative sales where multiple farmers are paid from a single escrow
- **Telebirr webhook**: Replace polling with real-time webhook notifications from Telebirr
- **USSD payment flow**: Support buyers who initiate payment via Telebirr USSD (`*127#`) instead of in-app
- **Insurance integration (F-27)**: Link escrow to AICE insurance for high-value shipments
- **Transaction analytics**: Dashboard showing platform transaction volume, commission revenue, dispute rates
- **Trucker payment**: Separate escrow flow for transport payment (currently out of scope -- farmer-buyer only)
- **Escrow expiry notifications**: Push notification 24 hours before auto-refund deadline

### Performance
- Implement DynamoDB Streams for real-time escrow state change events
- Add CloudWatch custom metrics: escrow initiation rate, release latency, dispute rate
- Optimize reconciliation Lambda with parallel Telebirr queries
